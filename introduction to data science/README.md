# Introduction-to-Data-Science

This course is an introduction to the basics of statistical programming, targeted at entering statistics master students with minimal prior programming knowledge. Examples from data science will be used throughout the course for demonstration.  Students will be introduced to basic machine learning topics such as classification, regression, and clustering methods, resampling techniques including the bootstrap, cross-validation, and permutation tests, as well as the basics of optimization. 

(Week 1) Introduction to R and RStudio. Working with data in R. Linear algebra review.

(Week 2) Working with data in R continued including data frames and iterative coding. Linear algebra for linear regression.

(Week 3) Exploratory data analysis and base R graphics. Bootstrap regression.

(Week 4) Web scraping and how to handle textual data: strings and regular expressions.

(Week 5) Functions. Basic classifiers like k Nearest Neighbors, LOESS. Cross-validation.

(Week 6) Visualization and advanced R graphics (ggplot).

(Week 7) Midterm Exam

(Week 8) R commands for parametric distributions and some review: MLE, the multivariate Gaussian distribution, and gradients.

(Week 9) Random number generation and simulations. Permutation tests.

(Week 10) Optimization (gradient descent).

(Week 11) k means clustering and PCA.

(Week 12) Debugging and testing code. Split/Apply/Combine and plyr.

(Week 13) Databases and Parallel Processing.
